# 👋 Hi, I'm Anwar

### 🧪 ChromeOS Peripheral QA • Automation • Python • Docker

I work on the **ChromeOS Peripheral Team**, focusing on automation, device qualification, debugging, and triaging issues across ChromeOS and AndroidOS. I have hands-on experience using **Allion fixtures**, custom test frameworks, and internal automation tools to validate peripherals in real-world and lab environments.

I enjoy building lightweight tools that make testing faster and more reliable — especially utilities for log parsing, automation workflows, and algorithm problem-solving.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools I Use

- **Languages:** Python, Bash  
- **Platforms:** ChromeOS, AndroidOS, Linux  
- **Automation:** Docker, internal ChromeOS automation frameworks, Allion fixture control  
- **Testing/Debugging:** Device logs, USB/I2C/SPI triage, peripheral qualification workflows  
- **Problem Solving:** Algorithms, LeetCode patterns, recursion, sliding window, bit manipulation

## 📌 Pinned Projects (More Coming Soon)

### 🔹 Log Analyzer — *Java*
A CLI tool for parsing test logs from Allion-controlled peripherals, detecting disconnects, timing issues, and communication failures.

### 🔹 Get Weather — *Python*
Lightweight automation for collecting and tagging USB attach/detach patterns on ChromeOS DUTs.
